<h2> Summary <h2>
What this project entailed was refactoring the existing html and css, so essentially cleaning it and making each page more concise. First, I analyzed the html and added in comments, as well html syntax elements like <code><header></code> and <code><section></code>. Then I tried to organized the html to make it appear easier to read and view. After that, I examined the css to see if there were any similaries between classes. <br>
As such, I found that multiple classes had the same attributes and didn't need to be different classes. I then went to the html page and examined all the classes and changed some to match each other. After that, I went into the CSS file and renamed some classes, while deleting other portions. I then made comments on the CSS file to demonstrate where I deleted certain portions of code.
